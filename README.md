# EventEmitter

### Info
Message queue for events. Is used for sending events, requests, notify information and
binding events on dom elements. It is a minimalistic library (< 8kB min file) and is really
simple to use it.

### How to install

Download and install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Run command `npm install`

### How to release

- install
- commit changes
- bump version in package json
- run grunt default task
- run npm publish in root directory

### Methods

#### .create(context)

It's method for creating new emitter with given `context`. Context can be any object od any function.
It is use for manipulation with handlers. More information in section "How to use it"

#### .event(name, params)

Call event with given `name` and send through given `params`. This function is call immediately
after you call it.

#### .notify(name, params)

Call notify with given `name` and send through given `params`. This function is same like `.event()`
but it can be called after same time. It's only notifier and you cannot determine when it's called, because there can be
timeout due to other events, requests or notify.

#### .request(name, params)

Call request with given `name` and send through given `params` and get return from this call.
This is similar to `.event()` but this function return value. This is a really special method and EventEmitter check if
it's right called. If `.request()` has not any handler, than fail because without handler you can not get return value. Call
also fail if there are more handlers than one, because you can not get return value from more functions.

#### .ctxRequest(name, params)

Same as `.request` above, but looks up for event with same context as callee

#### .demand(name, params)

Call request with given `name` and send through given `params` and get return from this call.
This is similar to `.request()` but this function return value and event return `undefined`. If `.demand()` has not
any handler, than do not fail and return `undefined`. Call also fail if there are more handlers than one,
because you can not get return value from more functions.

#### .subscribe()

This method is used for subscribing for events, that are triggered by `.event()`, `.notify()` or `.request()`.
You can use it for your custom events or bind it to dom element. More information in section "How to use it"

#### .unsubscribe()

This method is used for stop listening for events, that are triggered by `.event()`, `.notify()` or `.request()`.
More information in section "How to use it"

#### .interrupt(event, stopProp, cancelDef)

This function is used to stop browser event. There are parameters for stop propagation
and cancel default action. It's helper function.

#### .watching(name)

This function is used for getting number of listener, who use `.subscribe()` method. If function return `0`, nobody listen
on event and is not necessary to call it.

#### .debugMode(state, filters)

You can turn on debug mode and filter some specific events. Other events will be writen into
 browser console with all parameters.

### How to use it

You can use this library in global way. There is global variable `EventEmitter`.

#### Example 1

```javascript
EventEmitter.subscribe("MyEvent", function (data) {
    console.log("You handler for event");
});
EventEmitter.event("MyEvent");
EventEmitter.event("MyEvent", [true, "param2"]);
```

In this example you can see basic usages of emitter. You can subscribe for event and call event with or without parameters.
But there are two main problems. You can not destroy this handler for MyEvent, because you don't have original handler and also
you don't have context, so in handler is invalid pointer on `this`. We can make modification for first problem.

#### Example 1 - first problem solve

```javascript
var handler = function (data) {
  console.log("You handler for event");
};
EventEmitter.subscribe("MyEvent", handler);
EventEmitter.event("MyEvent");
EventEmitter.event("MyEvent", [true, "param2"]);
EventEmitter.unsubscribe("MyEvent", handler);
```

So now we can unsubscribe our event. Now we must solve the second problem. Context.

#### Example 1 - second problem solve

```javascript
var emitter,
    context = {},
    handler = function (data) {
  console.log("You handler for event with context from 'context' variable.");
};
emitter = EventEmitter.create(context);
emitter.subscribe("MyEvent", handler);
emitter.event("MyEvent");
emitter.event("MyEvent", [true, "param2"]);
emitter.unsubscribe("MyEvent", handler);
```

Now we have solve second problem. This is the recommended use of EventEmitter. In every file create new instance with
`this` as a context. If you implemented destroy on object, you can call `emitter.unsubscribe()` and all handlers for context
will be destroyed. So we can update last example for complete clean all events.

#### Example 2

```javascript
var emitter,
    context = {},
    handler = function (data) {
  console.log("You handler for event wit context from 'context' variable.");
};
emitter = EventEmitter.create(context);
emitter.subscribe("MyEvent", handler);
emitter.subscribe("MyEventSecond", handler);
emitter.event("MyEvent");
emitter.event("MyEvent", [true, "param2"]);
emitter.unsubscribe();
```

And last part is binding to DOM elements. It's easy like others thing before.


#### Example 3

```javascript
var emitter,
    context = {},
    handler = function (data) {
  console.log("Clicked on body and destroy.");
  emitter.unsubscribe();
  //emitter.unsubscribe(document.body, "click", handler);
};
emitter = EventEmitter.create(context);
emitter.subscribe(document.body, "click", handler);
```
